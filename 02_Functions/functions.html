    <h1>I can do that</h1>
    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world
        once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly
        when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now
        we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it
        wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

    <h1>Is she dead, yes or no?</h1>
    <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
        transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong
        to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb
        ass. </p>

    <h1>I'm serious as a heart attack</h1>
    <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
        You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
        We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
        connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

    <h1>I gotta piss</h1>
    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how
        you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
        friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
        called me Mr Glass. </p>

        to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb
        ass. </p>

    <h1>Are you ready for the truth?</h1>
    <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
        You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
        We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
        connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

    <h1>We happy?</h1>
    <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
        into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
        better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

    <h1>Hold on to your butts</h1>
    <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
        it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical
        helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must
        think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

    <h1>I'm serious as a heart attack</h1>
    <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
        someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
        the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
        you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
        motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>
